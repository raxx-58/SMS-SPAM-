# SMS-SPAM-
Overview
This project implements a SMS spam detector using Machine Learning algorithms, primarily based on the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The detector is capable of analyzing text messages and determining whether they are spam or not. The project also includes vectorization using three different algorithms to optimize the output.

Features

    Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm with precision 1.
    Streamlit frontend for user-friendly interaction.
    Vectorization using three different algorithms for enhanced performance.

Installation

    Dependencies
        Python 3.x
        pip (Python package installer)
        Required libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, streamlit
    Instructions
        1.Clone the repository:
            git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-spam-detector.git
            cd sms-spam-detector
        2.Install dependencies
            pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    1.Run the streamlit app:
        streamlit run app.py
    2.Open your web browser and navigate to https://localhost:8501
    3.Enter a random message into the provided input field and click the "Check" button        to determine if it is spam or not.
