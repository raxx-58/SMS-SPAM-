# SMS-SPAM-
Overview
This project implements a SMS spam detector using Machine Learning algorithms, primarily based on the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The detector is capable of analyzing text messages and determining whether they are spam or not. The project also includes vectorization using three different algorithms to optimize the output.

Features
Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm with precision 1.
Streamlit frontend for user-friendly interaction.
Vectorization using three different algorithms for enhanced performance.
